Advanced Implementation of the classic Tetris game!

This project is an advanced implementation of the classic Tetris game, developed as part of a programming assignment for my Software Engineering course at Iowa State University. The game features a variety of complex shapes, including the SnakingPiece, and incorporates object-oriented design principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and recursion.
